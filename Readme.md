### Initialization Process

Create Wallet

- Users generate a wallet and securely store the session key on other devices like a phone or USB.

Configure Inheritance:

- Users set up inheritance settings, specifying the duration of inactivity required to activate inheritance and defining the eligibility criteria for inheritance activation.

---

### Inheritance Activation Process:

Caller Eligibility Verification

- When an eligible person intends to activate inheritance, the caller's eligibility is `validated on-chain using the Sismo connect`.

Wallet Inactivity Check

- The system checks if the target wallet has remained inactive for the specified duration. This is done by comparing nonces between two block numbers. To verify the inactivity duration, Bacalaha utilizes the `account nonce storage proof provided by Heorodotus`.

Inheritance Execution

- If the caller is deemed eligible and the wallet has been inactive for the required duration, the inheritance is executed through the smart contract, securely transferring ownership of the assets.

## Conclusion

By incorporating webAuth for key management and implementing an inheritance feature, Bacalaha provides users with a secure and convenient solution for managing their crypto assets, ensuring that even in unforeseen circumstances, their assets can be seamlessly transferred to the designated inheritors.
